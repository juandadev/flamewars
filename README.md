## How To Use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/thomasnrggo/flamewars.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd flamewars

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

#Set your environment variables renaming the env.local.example template to env.local
BASE_URL=http://your-project-path
JWT_SECRET=a-secret-key-for-jwt-tokens

# Run the app
$ npm run dev
```

At this point there's no need to create a database for the users, there are registered on the server.js file in the root project. Soon we're gonna implement some database service to store all the data.

If you want to test the admin commands to create voting events you can manually add a user with `role: "admin"` in the `server.js` file located in the project's root or use the test user: **username: admin, password: 123**.
